# Online-Judge
This is the code for an online judge. I used it during a coding competition in my college. It has index.html as home page 
which has a nav-bar of links to 5 problems. Each problem page contains Problem statement and option for downloading and uploading input and output file. All participants were inteneded to download the input file, run their programs on these case and upload the output file generated Along with their source code. On upload a shell script runs, that mathces users output with correct output and announces
the verdicet whether answer was correct or not.
