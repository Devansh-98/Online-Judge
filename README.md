# Online-Judge
This is the code for an online judge. I used it during a coding competition in my college. It has index.html as home page 
which has a nav-bar of links to 5 problems. Each problem page contains Problem statement and option for downloading and uploading input and output file. All participants were inteneded to download the input file, run their programs on these cases and upload the output file generated along with their source code. On pressing submit button, a shell script runs, that matches user's output with correct output and announces the verdict, whether answer was correct or not.
Frontend of this judge is written in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Php is used for backend programming. Answer matching is done by shell scripting.
